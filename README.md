This is a central backend I created exclusively for
my apps. I didnt want the hassle of several separate
backends, so I created this. This serves as cloud
storage and account management for my apps, basically.

This system is not fully implemented in any of my
apps (like librerooms.org) as of yet because I
basically need to rewrite many parts of them
to work with this new system.
